Search spotify app is used to search Spotify detabase with artist's name, find the artist's albums and tracks, preview them and it even links to original spotify web page to buy. 

Used Angular 2 for functionality and development, bootstrap for UI, Spotify API for integration.

Just download the project and run the project using 'npm start' like any other Angular 2 project.
